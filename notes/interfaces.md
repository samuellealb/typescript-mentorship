# Interfaces
  - Interfaces are typescript only feature, existing only in development and compilation time. There are no transpiled interfaces in the final JavaScript code.
  - Interfaces are used to define the structure of an object.
  - This makes them less flexible the custom types, which can define any type of data, but makes them more specific.
  - You can implement an interface in a class to enforce the structure of the class.
  - Interfaces can be extended to create new interfaces. This is useful when you want to add new properties to an existing interface.
  - Differently from Classes, you can extend multiple Interfaces at once.
