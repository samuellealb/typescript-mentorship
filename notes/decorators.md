### Class Decorators
Class decorators are functions that are applied to the constructor of a class. They can be used to modify or replace the class definition. In the `decorators.ts` file, the `Logger` and `WithTemplate` decorators are examples of class decorators that log information and manipulate the DOM.

### Property Decorators
Property decorators are functions that are applied to a property in a class. They can be used to observe, modify, or replace property definitions. The `Log` decorator in the `decorators.ts` file is an example that logs information about the property it is applied to.

### Accessor Decorators
Accessor decorators are functions that are applied to the accessors (getters and setters) of a class property. They can be used to observe, modify, or replace accessor definitions. The `Log2` decorator in the `decorators.ts` file logs information about the accessor it is applied to.

### Method Decorators
Method decorators are functions that are applied to a method in a class. They can be used to observe, modify, or replace method definitions. The `Log3` decorator in the `decorators.ts` file logs information about the method it is applied to.

### Parameter Decorators
Parameter decorators are functions that are applied to the parameters of a method in a class. They can be used to observe, modify, or replace parameter definitions. The `Log4` decorator in the `decorators.ts` file logs information about the parameter it is applied to.

### Component Decorators
Component decorators are used to define custom HTML elements and their behavior. In the `decorators.ts` file, the `Heading` and `Paragraph` decorators are examples that manipulate the DOM to render custom components.

### Validation with Decorators
Validation decorators are used to enforce validation rules on class properties. In the `decorators.ts` file, the `Required` and `PositiveNumber` decorators are examples that add validation rules to properties, and the `Validate` function checks if an object meets these validation rules.
